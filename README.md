ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Analytics Dashboard: CAC, LTV, ROI & Retention
Overview

How can marketing teams measure the true value of their customer acquisition strategies?
This project simulates an end-to-end marketing analytics workflow, from data creation to interactive dashboarding.
The goal was to model Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), Return on Investment (ROI), and Retention, then present them in a way that enables quick decision-making.

Tools & Methods: Python (Pandas), Tableau, Cohort Analysis, ROI & LTV Modeling.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Trends over time, broken down by marketing channel.

Return on Investment (ROI): Clear comparisons of channel performance.

Lifetime Value (LTV): Modeled to assess long-term customer profitability.

Retention Cohorts: Visualized retention curves to highlight customer stickiness.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Preview

The Tableau dashboard provides four interactive views for marketing leaders:

CAC by Month & Channel â†’ Monitor acquisition cost efficiency over time.

ROI by Channel â†’ Identify the most profitable acquisition sources.

LTV by Channel â†’ See where long-term customer value is strongest.

Retention Cohorts â†’ Evaluate customer loyalty and predict churn risk.

ðŸ’¡ Business Value

This project demonstrates how marketing teams can move from raw data to insights:

Quickly identify which channels are most cost-effective.

Understand where to invest for long-term growth (high LTV).

Use retention cohorts to guide customer engagement strategies.

By combining Python for modeling with Tableau for visualization, it shows the value of creating dashboards that not only report metrics, but also drive strategic decisions.

ðŸ‘‰ Next steps: expand the simulation with realistic churn modeling and integrate additional metrics like Customer Lifetime Margin and Multi-Touch Attribution.
